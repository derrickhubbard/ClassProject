Hello, my name is Derrick Hubbard I would like to discuss how my application the simple calendar will work. The most important apart of the data structure in my project is the function of the primary keys. The main primary key will be the users profile this key will be responsible for the primary communication function between all other forms of data within my application. I also have foreign keys that will help to provide data validation between some of the other types of data. Once the user profile is completed implemented all the data needs for my project will be available to the calendar and the users.

The foreign keys will also have the responsible of communicating directly with the userâ€™s profile providing critical information that will allow the overall application to function properly. The calendar will also assist user's profile by providing security functions for the app. All data within this application will need to be in a minimum in the third normal form. This will allow the communication between data bases and the application to happen smoothly.

I am still figuring out the best way to implement various data requirements for my application. I chose third normal form because I believe it will provide the smoothest communication and flow of data within my application. I also think it will assist the primary key and accomplishing its overall job of communicating with the calendar which connects the profiles throughout the application.
